abstract = {The exoplanet HD 97658b provides a rare opportunity to probe the atmospheric composition and evolution of moderately irradiated super-Earths. It transits a bright K star at a moderate orbital distance of 0.08 au. Its low density is compatible with a massive steam envelope that could photodissociate at high altitudes and become observable as escaping neutral hydrogen. Our analysis of three transits with HST/STIS at Lyman-$\alpha$ reveals no such signature, suggesting that the thermosphere of HD 97658b is not hydrodynamically expanding and is subjected to a low escape of neutral hydrogen ({\textless}10 8 g s −1 at 3$\sigma$). Using HST/STIS Lyman-$\alpha$ observations and Chandra/ACIS-S {\&} XMM-Newton/EPIC X-ray observations at different epochs, we find that HD 97658 is in fact a weak and soft X-ray source with signs of chromospheric variability in the Lyman-$\alpha$ line core. We determine an average reference for the intrinsic Lyman-$\alpha$ line and X-EUV (XUV) spectrum of the star, and show that HD 97658 b is in mild conditions of irradiation compared to other known evaporating exoplanets with an XUV irradiation about three times lower than the evaporating warm Neptune GJ436 b. This could be the reason why the thermosphere of HD 97658b is not expanding: the low XUV irradiation prevents an efficient photodissociation of any putative steam envelope. Alternatively, it could be linked to a low hydrogen content or inefficient conversion of the stellar energy input. The HD 97658 system provides clues for understanding the stability of low-mass planet atmospheres in terms of composition, planetary density, and irradiation. Our study of HD 97658 b can be seen as a control experiment of our methodology, confirming that it does not bias detections of atmospheric escape and underlining its strength and reliability. Our results show that stellar activity can be efficiently discriminated from absorption signatures by a transiting exospheric cloud. They also highlight the potential of observing the upper atmosphere of small transiting planets to probe their physical and chemical properties.},

abstract = {One of the main advantages of space observatories is the quality and stability of the point spread function that allows programs not feasible from the ground. However, when pushed to the limits, even the Hubble Space Telescope exhibits variations in the PSF that can be problematic for studies like weak lensing or identification of the host halos of bright quasars at high redshift. These variations are primarily due to small displacements in the focus of the telescope, which to a first approximation can be ascribed to temperature variations. The aim of this report is to characterize the variation of the focus position for HST in terms of the average temperature sensor values of the telescope. We propose a comprehensive temperature-focus model able to predict the position of the focus at the micron level over a dynamic range that extends from sub-orbital variations ({\textless} 1 hour) to seasonal and yearly variations. This allows us to predict the focus position significantly more accurately than using interpolation of the monthly direct measurements. Our model is also at least as accurate as the previously proposed breathing model for sub-orbital variations and it is the first one that describes longer term variations, potentially helping the determination of the model point spread function for observations lacking reference point sources.},

abstract = {To date, more than 750 planets have been discovered orbiting stars other than the Sun. Two sub-classes of these exoplanets, " hot Jupiters " and their less massive counterparts " hot Neptunes, " provide a unique opportunity to study the extended atmospheres of planets outside of our solar system. We describe here the first far-ultraviolet transit study of a hot Neptune, specifically GJ436b, for which we use HST /STIS Lyman-$\alpha$ spectra to measure stellar flux as a function of time, observing variations due to absorption from the planetary atmosphere during transit. This analysis permits us to derive information about atmospheric extent, mass-loss rate from the planet, and interactions between the star and planet. We observe an evolution of the Lyman-$\alpha$ lightcurve with a transit depth of GJ436b from 8.8 ± 4.5{\%} near mid-transit, to 22.9 ± 3.9{\%} ∼ 2 hours after the nominal geometric egress of the planet. Using data from the time-tag mode and considering astrophysical noise from stellar variability, we calculate a post-egress occultation of 23.7 ± 4.5{\%}, demonstrating that the signature is statistically significant and of greater amplitude than can be attributed to stellar fluctuations alone. The extended egress absorption indicates the probable existence of a comet-like tail trailing the exoplanet. We calculate a mass-loss rate for GJ436b in the range of 3.7 × 10 6 − 1.},

abstract = {The ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 hosts seven Earth-size transiting planets, some of which could harbour liquid water on their surfaces. UV observations are essential to measure their high-energy irradiation, and to search for photodissociated water escaping from their putative atmospheres. Our new observations of TRAPPIST-1 Ly-$\alpha$ line during the transit of TRAPPIST-1c show an evolution of the star emission over three months, preventing us from assessing the presence of an extended hydrogen exosphere. Based on the current knowledge of the stellar irradiation, we investigated the likely history of water loss in the system. Planets b to d might still be in a runaway phase, and planets within the orbit of TRAPPIST-1g could have lost more than 20 Earth oceans after 8 Gyr of hydrodynamic escape. However, TRAPPIST-1e to h might have lost less than 3 Earth oceans if hydrodynamic escape stopped once they entered the habitable zone. We caution that these estimates remain limited by the large uncertainty on the planet masses. They likely represent upper limits on the actual water loss because our assumptions maximize the XUV-driven escape, while photodissociation in the upper atmospheres should be the limiting process. Late-stage outgassing could also have contributed significant amounts of water for the outer, more massive planets after they entered the habitable zone. While our results suggest that the outer planets are the best candidates to search for water with the JWST, they also highlight the need for theoretical studies and complementary observations in all wavelength domains to determine the nature of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and their potential habitability.},

abstract = {The M dwarf GJ 436 hosts a transiting warm Neptune known to experience atmospheric escape. Previous observations revealed the presence of a giant hydrogen exosphere transiting the star for more than 5 h, and absorbing up to 56{\%} of the flux in the blue wing of the stellar Lyman-{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater} line of neutral hydrogen (H i Ly{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater}). The unexpected size of this comet-like exosphere prevented observing the full transit of its tail. In this Letter, we present new Ly{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater} observations of GJ 436 obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument onboard the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Hubble {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Space Telescope. The stability of the Ly{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater} line over six years allowed us to combine these new observations with archival data sets, substantially expanding the coverage of the exospheric transit. Hydrogen atoms in the tail of the exospheric cloud keep occulting the star for 10–25 h after the transit of the planet, remarkably confirming a previous prediction based on 3D numerical simulations with the EVaporating Exoplanet code (EVE). This result strengthens the interpretation that the exosphere of GJ 436b is shaped by both radiative braking and charge exchanges with the stellar wind. We further report flux decreases of 15 ± 2{\%} and 47 ± 10{\%} in the red wing of the Ly{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater} line and in the line of ionised silicon (Si iii). Despite some temporal variability possibly linked with stellar activity, these two signals occur during the exospheric transit and could be of planetary origin. Follow-up observations will be required to assess the possibility that the redshifted Ly{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater} and Si iii absorption signatures arise from interactions between the exospheric flow and the magnetic field of the star.},

abstract = {Observations of the warm Neptune GJ 436 b were performed with HST/STIS at three different epochs (2012, 2013, 2014) in the stellar Lyman-{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater} line. They showed deep, repeated transits that were attributed to a giant exosphere of neutral hydrogen. The low radiation pressure from the M-dwarf host star was shown to play a major role in the dynamics of the escaping gas and its dispersion within a large volume around the planet. Yet by itself it cannot explain the specific time-variable spectral features detected in each transit. Here we investigate the combined role of radiative braking and stellar wind interactions using numerical simulations with the EVaporating Exoplanet code (EVE) and we derive atmospheric and stellar properties through the direct comparison of simulated and observed spectra. The first epoch of observations is difficult to interpret because of the lack of out-of-transit data. In contrast, the results of our simulations match the observations obtained in 2013 and 2014 well. The sharp early ingresses observed in these epochs come from the abrasion of the planetary coma by the stellar wind. Spectra observed at later times during the transit can be produced by a dual exosphere of planetary neutrals (escaped from the upper atmosphere of the planet) and neutralized protons (created by charge-exchange with the stellar wind). We find similar properties at both epochs for the planetary escape rate ({\~{}}2.5 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}8{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} g s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}), the stellar photoionization rate ({\~{}}2 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}), the stellar wind bulk velocity ({\~{}}85 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}), and its kinetic dispersion velocity ({\~{}}10 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, corresponding to a kinetic temperature of 12 000 K). We also find high velocities for the escaping gas ({\~{}}50−60 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}) that may indicate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves that dissipate in the upper atmosphere and drive the planetary outflow. In 2014 the high density of the stellar wind ({\~{}}3 × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}) led to the formation of an exospheric tail that was mainly composed of neutralized protons and produced a stable absorption signature during and after the transit. The observations of GJ 436 b allow for the first time to clearly separate the contributions of radiation pressure and stellar wind and to probe the regions of the exosphere shaped by each mechanism. The overall shape of the cloud, which is constant over time, is caused by the stability of the stellar emission and the planetary mass loss, while the local changes in the cloud structure can be interpreted as variations in the density of the stellar wind.},

We detect the Lyman-{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater} line of TRAPPIST-1, making it the coldest exoplanet host star for which this line has been measured. We reconstruct the intrinsic line profile, showing that it lacks broad wings and is much fainter than expected from the stellar X-ray emission. TRAPPIST-1 has a similar X-ray emission as Proxima Cen but a much lower Ly-{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater} emission. This suggests that TRAPPIST-1 chromosphere is only moderately active compared to its transition region and corona. We estimated the atmospheric mass loss rates for all planets, and found that despite a moderate extreme UV emission the total XUV irradiation could be strong enough to strip the atmospheres of the inner planets in a few billions years. We detect marginal flux decreases at the times of TRAPPIST-1b and c transits, which might originate from stellar activity, but could also hint at the presence of extended hydrogen exospheres. Understanding the origin of these Lyman-{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater} variations will be crucial in assessing the atmospheric stability and potential habitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.},

abstract = {We search the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive for previously unanalyzed ob-servations of stellar H I Ly$\alpha$ emission lines, our primary purpose being to look for new detections of Ly$\alpha$ absorption from the outer heliosphere, and to also search for analogous absorption from the astrospheres surrounding the observed stars. The astrospheric ab-sorption is of particular interest because it can be used to study solar-like stellar winds that are otherwise undetectable. We find and analyze 33 HST Ly$\alpha$ spectra in the archive. All the spectra were taken with the E140M grating of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board HST. The HST/STIS spectra yield 4 new detections of heliospheric absorption (70 Oph, $\xi$ Boo, 61 Vir, and HD 165185) and 7 new detections of astrospheric absorption (EV Lac, 70 Oph, $\xi$ Boo, 61 Vir, $\delta$ Eri, HD 128987, and DK UMa), doubling the previous number of heliospheric and astro-spheric detections. When combined with previous results, 10 of 17 lines of sight within 10 pc yield detections of astrospheric absorption. This high detection fraction implies that most of the ISM within 10 pc must be at least partially neutral, since the presence of H I within the ISM surrounding the observed star is necessary for an astrospheric de-tection. In contrast, the detection percentage is only 9.7{\%} (3 out of 31) for stars beyond 10 pc. Our Ly$\alpha$ analyses provide measurements of ISM H I and D I column densities for all 33 lines of sight, and we discuss some implications of these results. Finally, we measure chromospheric Ly$\alpha$ fluxes from the observed stars. We use these fluxes to de-termine how Ly$\alpha$ flux correlates with coronal X-ray and chromospheric Mg II emission, and we also study how Ly$\alpha$ emission depends on stellar rotation.},

The galactic dis-tribution of all these sources is non-uniform with number en-hancements seen towards the Hyades cluster, in line-of-sight along the $\beta$ CMa interstellar tunnel and towards high galactic latitudes in both hemispheres. A comparison of the distribution of these EUV sources with that of the neutral absorption bound-ary of the Local Bubble region derived from the interstellar NaI observations of Sfeir et al. (1999) reveals that vast majority of EUV sources are contained within this neutral boundary. How-ever, at high galactic latitudes 20 extragalactic EUV sources have been detected along lines-of-sight with low neutral column density, and is consistent with the local interstellar cavity being " open-ended " in the galactic halo. This " Local Chimney " opens towards two regions of enhanced intensity of the 0.25 keV soft X-ray background emission at high galactic latitudes. Although the hot Local Bubble gas is still contained within a cold, neutral interstellar gas boundary in the galactic plane, it has probably expanded into the halo to produce the Local Chimney feature.},

abstract = {Planetary atmospheres have their birth in certain physical and chemical events in the primitive solar nebula. These events involve irreversible volatile retention through condensation and accretion of planetesimals and giant planets whose volatile inventory can survive the subsequent dissipation of the nebula. Clues to these earliest processes are inferred not without difficulty from the observed volatile compositions of present-day planetary and satellite atmospheres, meteorites and comets. The origins of terrestrial-type atmospheres appear to have involved outgassing of the solid planet with compositions and rates intimately connected to the late growth and thermal evolution of the planet itself. Subsequent evolutionary processes such as escape of certain light elements and cometary and meteoritic infall appear to be of general significance; others such as atmosphere- hydrosphere-crust interactions and development and influence of living organisms are highly specific. Our knowledge of these highly specific areas is largely restricted to the last 3.8 billion years on earth and is based upon analyses of the geologic record which are not presently available for Venus, Titan or the pre-Archean earth and are only available in a superficial way for Mars. In this introductory paper we attempt to draw an integrated picture of the atmospheric evolutionary process being careful to define the outstanding problems, to differentiate theory from fact, and to emphasize the strengths and weaknesses of a priori and a posteriori approaches to these problems.},

We derive projected morphologies of all clouds and estimate the volume filling factor of warm partially ionized material in the LISM to be between {\~{}}5.5{\%} and 19{\%}. Relative velocities of potentially interacting clouds are often supersonic, consistent with heating, turbulent, and metal depletion properties.

abstract = {In this second paper in a series on the structure of the local interstellar medium (LISM), we construct a three-dimensional model of the local interstellar cloud (LIC) based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE), and ground-based Ca II spectra. Starting with hydrogen column densities derived from deuterium column densities measured with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph instrument on HST for 16 lines of sight to nearby stars, we derive a model consisting of the sum of nine spherical harmonics that best fit the data. We then rederive the model by including the lines of sight to three hot white dwarfs observed by EUVE and 13 lines of sight with Ca II column densities at the projected LIC velocity. The LIC model is clearly not a long thin filamentary structure like optical images of some interstellar clouds (e.g., reflection nebulae in the Pleiades), but neither is it spherical in shape. As seen from the north Galactic pole, the LIC is egg-shaped with an axis of symmetry that points in the direction l{\~{}}315deg. Since the direction of the center of the Scorpius-Centaurus association is l=320deg, the shape of the LIC could be determined by the flow of hot gas from Sco-Cen. The model shows that the Sun is located just inside the LIC in the direction of the Galactic center and toward the north Galactic pole. The absence of Mg II absorption at the LIC velocity toward $\alpha$ Cen indicates that the distance to the edge of the LIC in this direction is {\textless}=0.05 pc and the Sun should cross the boundary between the LIC and the Galactic (G) cloud in less than 3000 yr. We estimate that the volume of the LIC is about 93 pc3 and its mass is about 0.32 Msolar. The physical parameters and hydrogen column density of the LIC are roughly consistent with theoretical models of the warm interstellar medium that assume pressure and ionization equilibrium. However, the empirical hydrogen ionization of the LIC is much higher and the gas temperature lower than the theoretical models predict. Therefore, the ionization is likely due to shock activity from a nearby supernova that has not yet reached equilibrium. The higher ionization increases the gas cooling, which can explain why the gas is 2400 K cooler than the ionization equilibrium models predict. Computed and observed temperatures are in agreement for a model with the observed LIC electron density. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

abstract = {Kepler-444 provides a unique opportunity to probe the atmospheric composition and evolution of a compact system of exoplanets smaller than the Earth. Five planets transit this bright K star at close orbital distances, but they are too small for their putative lower atmosphere to be probed at optical/infrared wavelengths. We used the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph instrument onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to search for the signature of the planet's upper atmospheres at six independent epochs in the Ly-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} line. We detect significant flux variations during the transits of both Kepler-444e and f ({\~{}}20{\%}), and also at a time when none of the known planets was transiting ({\~{}}40{\%}). Variability in the transition region and corona of the host star might be the source of these variations. Yet, their amplitude over short time scales ({\~{}}2-3 hours) is surprisingly strong for this old (11.2+-1.0Gyr) and apparently quiet main-sequence star. Alternatively, we show that the in-transits variations could be explained by absorption from neutral hydrogen exospheres trailing the two outer planets (Kepler-444e and f). They would have to contain substantial amounts of water to replenish such hydrogen exospheres, which would reveal them as the first confirmed ocean-planets. The out-of-transit variations, however, would require the presence of a yet-undetected Kepler-444g at larger orbital distance, casting doubt on the planetary origin scenario. Using HARPS-N observations in the sodium doublet, we derived the properties of two Interstellar Medium clouds along the line-of-sight toward Kepler-444. This allowed us to reconstruct the stellar Ly-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} line profile and to estimate the XUV irradiation from the star, which would still allow for a moderate mass loss from the outer planets after 11.2Gyr. Follow-up of the system at XUV wavelengths will be required to assess this tantalizing possibility.},

abstract = {The exoplanet HD97658b provides a rare opportunity to probe the atmospheric composition and evolution of moderately irradiated super-Earths. It transits a bright K star at a moderate orbital distance of 0.08 au. Its low density is compatible with a massive steam envelope that could photodissociate at high altitudes and become observable as escaping hydrogen. Our analysis of 3 transits with HST/STIS at Ly-alpha reveals no such signature, suggesting that the thermosphere is not hydrodynamically expanding and is subjected to a low escape of neutral hydrogen ({\textless}10{\^{}}8 g/s at 3 sigma). Using HST Ly-alpha and Chandra {\&} XMM-Newton observations at different epochs, we find that HD97658 is a weak and soft X-ray source with signs of chromospheric variability in the Ly-alpha line core. We determine an average reference for the intrinsic Ly-alpha line and XUV spectrum of the star, and show that HD97658 b is in mild conditions of irradiation compared to other known evaporating exoplanets with an XUV irradiation about 3 times lower than the evaporating warm Neptune GJ436 b. This could be why the thermosphere of HD97658b is not expanding: the low XUV irradiation prevents an efficient photodissociation of any putative steam envelope. Alternatively, it could be linked to a low hydrogen content or inefficient conversion of the stellar energy input. The HD97658 system provides clues for understanding the stability of low-mass planet atmospheres. Our study of HD97658 b can be seen as a control experiment of our methodology, confirming that it does not bias detections of atmospheric escape and underlining its strength and reliability. Our results show that stellar activity can be efficiently discriminated from absorption signatures by a transiting exospheric cloud. They also highlight the potential of observing the upper atmosphere of small transiting planets to probe their physical and chemical properties},

New resolved Lyman-alpha observations obtained with the STIS spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope in April 2010 and September 2011 confirmed that the planet is evaporating, and furthermore discovered significant temporal variations in the physical conditions of its evaporating atmosphere. Here we present a detailed analysis of the September 2011 observations of HD 189733b, when an atmospheric signature was detected. We present specific methods to find and characterize this absorption signature of escaping hydrogen in the Lyman-alpha line, and to calculate its false-positive probability, found to be 3.6{\%}. Taking advantage of the spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the STIS spectrograph, we also present new results on temporal and spectro-temporal variability of this absorption feature. We also report the observation of HD 189733b in other lines (SiIII at 1206.5A, NV at 1240A). Variations in these lines could be explained either by early occultation by a bow-shock rich in highly ionized species, or by stellar variations.},

abstract = {M-dwarf stars -- hydrogen-burning stars that are smaller than 60 per cent of the size of the Sun -- are the most common class of star in our Galaxy and outnumber Sun-like stars by a ratio of 12:1. Recent results have shown that M dwarfs host Earth-sized planets in great numbers: the average number of M-dwarf planets that are between 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of Earth is at least 1.4 per star. The nearest such planets known to transit their star are 39 parsecs away, too distant for detailed follow-up observations to measure the planetary masses or to study their atmospheres. Here we report observations of GJ 1132b, a planet with a size of 1.2 Earth radii that is transiting a small star 12 parsecs away. Our Doppler mass measurement of GJ 1132b yields a density consistent with an Earth-like bulk composition, similar to the compositions of the six known exoplanets with masses less than six times that of the Earth and precisely measured densities. Receiving 19 times more stellar radiation than the Earth, the planet is too hot to be habitable but is cool enough to support a substantial atmosphere, one that has probably been considerably depleted of hydrogen. Because the host star is nearby and only 21 per cent the radius of the Sun, existing and upcoming telescopes will be able to observe the composition and dynamics of the planetary atmosphere.},

Three HST/STIS observations were performed in the Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} line of GJ436 at different epochs, showing repeatable transits with large depths and extended durations. Here, we study the role played by stellar radiation pressure on the structure of the exosphere and its transmission spectrum. We found that the neutral hydrogen atoms in the exosphere of GJ436 b are not swept away by radiation pressure as shown to be the case for evaporating hot Jupiters. Instead, the low radiation pressure from the M-dwarf host star only brakes the gravitational fall of the escaping hydrogen toward the star and allows its dispersion within a large volume around the planet, yielding radial velocities up to about -120 km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} that match the observations. We performed numerical simulations with the EVaporating Exoplanets code (EVE) to study the influence of the escape rate, the planetary wind velocity, and the stellar photoionization.

abstract = {The changing view of planets orbiting low mass stars, M stars, as potentially hospitable worlds for life and its remote detection was motivated by several factors, including the demonstration of viable atmospheres and oceans on tidally locked planets, normal incidence of dust disks, including debris disks, detection of planets with masses in the 5–20 M range, and predictions of unusually strong spectral biosignatures. We present a critical discussion of M star properties that are relevant for the long- and short-term thermal, dynamical, geological, and environmental stability of conventional liquid water habitable zone (HZ) M star planets, and the advantages and disadvantages of M stars as targets in searches for terrestrial HZ planets using various detection techniques. Biological viability seems supported by unmatched very long-term stability conferred by tidal locking, small HZ size, an apparent shortfall of gas giant planet perturbers, immunity to large astrosphere compressions, and several other factors, assuming incidence and evolutionary rate of life benefit from lack of variability. Tectonic regulation of climate and dynamo generation of a protective magnetic field, especially for a planet in synchronous rotation, are important unresolved questions that must await improved geodynamic models, though they both probably impose constraints on the planet mass. M star HZ terrestrial planets must survive a number of early trials in order to enjoy their many Gyr of stability. Their formation may be jeopardized by an insufficient initial disk supply of solids, resulting in the formation of objects too small and/or dry for hab-itability. The small empirical gas giant fraction for M stars reduces the risk of formation suppression or orbit disruption from either migrating or nonmigrating giant planets, but effects of perturbations from lower mass planets in these systems are uncertain. During the first 1 Gyr, atmospheric retention is at peril because of intense and frequent stellar flares and sporadic energetic particle events, and impact erosion, both enhanced, the former dramatically, for M star HZ semimajor axes. Loss of atmosphere by interactions with energetic particles is likely unless the planetary magnetic moment is sufficiently large. For the smallest stellar masses a period of high planetary surface temperature, while the parent star approaches the main sequence, must be endured. The formation and retention of a thick atmosphere and a strong magnetic field as buffers for a sufficiently massive planet emerge as prerequisites for an M star planet to enter a long period of stability with its habitability intact. However, the star will then be subjected to short-term fluctuations with consequences including frequent unpredictable variation in atmospheric chemistry and surficial radiation field. After a review of evidence concerning disks and planets associated with M stars, we evaluate M stars as targets for future HZ planet search programs. Strong advantages of M stars for most approaches to HZ detection are offset by their faintness, leading to severe constraints due to accessible sample size, stellar crowding (transits), or angular size of the HZ (direct imaging). Gravitational lensing is unlikely to detect HZ M star planets because the HZ size decreases with mass faster than the Einstein ring size to which the method is sensitive. M star Earth-twin planets are predicted to exhibit surprisingly strong bands of nitrous oxide, methyl chloride, and methane, and work on signatures for other climate categories is summarized. The rest of the paper is devoted to an examination of evidence and implications of the unusual radiation and particle environments for atmospheric chemistry and surface radiation doses, and is summarized in the Synopsis. We conclude that attempts at remote sensing of biosignatures and nonbiological markers from M star planets are important, not as tests of any quantitative theories or rational arguments, but instead because they offer an inspection of the residues from a Gyr-long biochemistry experiment in the presence of extreme environmental fluctuations. A detection or repeated nondetections could provide a unique opportunity to partially answer a fundamental and recurrent question about the relation between stability and complexity, one that is not addressed by remote detection from a planet orbiting a solar-like star, and can only be studied on Earth using restricted microbial systems in serial evolution experiments or in artificial life simulations. This proposal requires a planet that has retained its atmosphere and a water supply. The discussion given here suggests that observations of M star exoplanets can decide this latter question with only slight modifications to plans already in place for direct imaging terrestrial exoplanet missions.},

abstract = {Doppler and transit surveys are finding extrasolar planets of ever smaller mass and radius, and are now sampling the domain of super Earths (1-3R). Recent results from the Doppler surveys suggest that discovery of a transiting super Earth in the habitable zone of a lower main sequence star may be possible. We evaluate the prospects for an all-sky transit survey targeted to the brightest stars, that would find the most favorable cases for photometric and spectroscopic characterization using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We use the proposed Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) as representative of an all-sky survey. We couple the simulated TESS yield to a sensitivity model for the MIRI and NIRSpec instruments on JWST. Our sensitivity model includes all currently known and anticipated sources of random and systematic error for these instruments. We focus on the TESS planets with radii between those of Earth and Neptune. Our simulations consider secondary eclipse filter photometry using JWST/MIRI, comparing the 11 and 15 $\mu$m bands to measure CO absorption in super Earths, as well as JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of water absorption from 1.7-3.0 $\mu$m, and CO absorption at 4.3 $\mu$m. We find that JWST will be capable of characterizing dozens of TESS super Earths with temperatures above the habitable range, using both MIRI and NIRspec. We project that TESS will discover about eight nearby habitable transiting super Earths, all orbiting lower-main-sequence stars. The principal sources of uncertainty in the prospective JWST characterization of habitable super Earths are super-Earth frequency and the nature of super-Earth atmospheres. Based on our estimates of these uncertainties, we project that JWST will be able to measure the temperature and identify molecular absorptions (water, CO) in one to four nearby habitable TESS super Earths orbiting lower-main-sequence stars.},

abstract = {The prospects for the habitability of M-dwarf planets have long been debated, due to key differences between the unique stellar and planetary environments around these low-mass stars, as compared to hotter, more luminous Sun-like stars. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made by both space- and ground-based observatories to measure the likelihood of small planets to orbit in the habitable zones of M-dwarf stars. We now know that most M dwarfs are hosts to closely-packed planetary systems characterized by a paucity of Jupiter-mass planets and the presence of multiple rocky planets, with roughly a third of these rocky M-dwarf planets orbiting within the habitable zone, where they have the potential to support liquid water on their surfaces. Theoretical studies have also quantified the effect on climate and habitability of the interaction between the spectral energy distribution of M-dwarf stars and the atmospheres and surfaces of their planets. These and other recent results fill in knowledge gaps that existed at the time of the previous overview papers published nearly a decade ago by Tarter et al. (2007) and Scalo et al. (2007). In this review we provide a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge of M-dwarf planet occurrence and habitability based on work done in this area over the past decade, and summarize future directions planned in this quickly evolving field.},

We detect two separate transit events at times that are consistent with the radial velocity measurements. In both cases, the detailed shape of the transit curve due to both the limb darkening of the star and the finite size of the planet is clearly evident. Assuming stellar parameters of 1.1 Rsolar and 1.1 Msolar, we find that the data are best interpreted as a gas giant with a radius of 1.27+/-0.02 RJup in an orbit with an inclination of 87.1d+/-0.2d. We present values for the planetary surface gravity, escape velocity, and average density and discuss the numerous observations that are warranted now that a planet is known to transit the disk of its parent star.},

abstract = {We present an improved estimate of the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting small stars by searching the full four-year Kepler data set for transiting planets using our own planet detection pipeline and conducting transit injection and recovery simulations to empirically measure the search completeness of our pipeline. We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find 0.56 (+0.06/-0.05) Earth-size planets (1-1.5 Earth radii) and 0.46 (+0.07/-0.05) super-Earths (1.5-2 Earth radii) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of {\$}2.5\backslashpm0.2{\$} planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 Earth radii and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of 0.16 (+0.17/-0.07) Earth-size planets and 0.12 (+0.10/-0.05) super-Earths per M dwarf habitable zone. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of 0.24 (+0.18/-0.08) Earth-size planets and 0.21 (+0.11/-0.06) super-Earths per M dwarf habitable zone. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are {\$}2.6\backslashpm0.4{\$} pc and 10.6 (+1.6/-1.8) pc away, respectively. If we include super-Earths, these distances diminish to {\$}2.1\backslashpm0.2{\$} pc and 8.6 (+0.7/-0.8) pc.},

abstract = {Exoplanets orbiting close to their parent stars could lose some fraction of their atmospheres because of the extreme irradiation. Atmospheric mass loss primarily affects low-mass exoplanets, leading to suggest that hot rocky planets might have begun as Neptune-like, but subsequently lost all of their atmospheres; however, no confident measurements have hitherto been available. The signature of this loss could be observed in the ultraviolet spectrum, when the planet and its escaping atmosphere transit the star, giving rise to deeper and longer transit signatures than in the optical spectrum. Here we report that in the ultraviolet the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b (also known as Gliese 436b) has transit depths of 56.3 +/- 3.5{\%} (1 sigma), far beyond the 0.69{\%} optical transit depth. The ultraviolet transits repeatedly start {\~{}}2 h before, and end {\textgreater}3 h after the {\~{}}1 h optical transit, which is substantially different from one previous claim (based on an inaccurate ephemeris). We infer from this that the planet is surrounded and trailed by a large exospheric cloud composed mainly of hydrogen atoms. We estimate a mass-loss rate in the range of {\~{}}10{\^{}}8-10{\^{}}9 g/s, which today is far too small to deplete the atmosphere of a Neptune-like planet in the lifetime of the parent star, but would have been much greater in the past.},

@article{Tarter2007,
abstract = {Stable, hydrogen-burning, M dwarf stars make up about 75{\%} of all stars in the Galaxy. They are extremely long-lived, and because they are much smaller in mass than the Sun (between 0.5 and 0.08 M(Sun)), their temperature and stellar luminosity are low and peaked in the red. We have re-examined what is known at present about the potential for a terrestrial planet forming within, or migrating into, the classic liquid-surface-water habitable zone close to an M dwarf star. Observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that planet-building materials are common around M dwarfs, but N-body simulations differ in their estimations of the likelihood of potentially habitable, wet planets that reside within their habitable zones, which are only about one-fifth to 1/50th of the width of that for a G star. Particularly in light of the claimed detection of the planets with masses as small as 5.5 and 7.5 M(Earth) orbiting M stars, there seems no reason to exclude the possibility of terrestrial planets. Tidally locked synchronous rotation within the narrow habitable zone does not necessarily lead to atmospheric collapse, and active stellar flaring may not be as much of an evolutionarily disadvantageous factor as has previously been supposed. We conclude that M dwarf stars may indeed be viable hosts for planets on which the origin and evolution of life can occur. A number of planetary processes such as cessation of geothermal activity or thermal and nonthermal atmospheric loss processes may limit the duration of planetary habitability to periods far shorter than the extreme lifetime of the M dwarf star. Nevertheless, it makes sense to include M dwarf stars in programs that seek to find habitable worlds and evidence of life. This paper presents the summary conclusions of an interdisciplinary workshop (http://mstars.seti.org) sponsored by the NASA Astrobiology Institute and convened at the SETI Institute.},

abstract = {The ultraviolet (UV) spectral energy distributions of low-mass (K- and M-type) stars play a critical role in the heating and chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres, but are not observationally well-constrained. Direct observations of the intrinsic flux of the Lyman alpha line (the dominant source of UV photons from low-mass stars) are challenging, as interstellar HI absorbs the entire line core for even the closest stars. To address the existing gap in empirical constraints on the UV flux of K and M dwarfs, the MUSCLES HST Treasury Survey has obtained UV observations of 11 nearby M and K dwarfs hosting exoplanets. This paper presents the Lyman alpha and extreme-UV spectral reconstructions for the MUSCLES targets. Most targets are optically inactive, but all exhibit significant UV activity. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to correct the observed Lyman alpha profiles for interstellar absorption, and we employ empirical relations to compute the extreme-UV spectral energy distribution from the intrinsic Lyman alpha flux in {\~{}}100 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} bins from 100-1170 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}}. The reconstructed Lyman alpha profiles have 300 km/s broad cores, while {\textgreater}1{\%} of the total intrinsic Lyman alpha flux is measured in extended wings between 300 km/s to 1200 km/s. The Lyman alpha surface flux positively correlates with the MgII surface flux and negatively correlates with the stellar rotation period. Stars with larger Lyman alpha surface flux also tend to have larger surface flux in ions formed at higher temperatures, but these correlations remain statistically insignificant in our sample of 11 stars. We also present HI column density measurements for 10 new sightlines through the local interstellar medium.},

abstract = {Recent observations of the transiting super-Earth GJ 1214b reveal that its atmosphere may be hydrogen-rich or water-rich in nature, with clouds or hazes potentially affecting its transmission spectrum in the optical and very-near-IR. Here we further examine the possibility that GJ 1214b does indeed possess a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, which is the hypothesis that is favored by models of the bulk composition of the planet. We study the effects of non-equilibrium chemistry (photochemistry, thermal chemistry, and mixing) on the planet's transmission spectrum. We furthermore examine the possibility that clouds could play a significant role in attenuating GJ 1214b's transmission spectrum at short wave- lengths. We find that non-equilibrium chemistry can have a large effect on the overall chemical composition of GJ 1214b's atmosphere, however these changes mostly take place above the height in the atmosphere that is probed by transmission spectroscopy. The effects of non-equilibrium chemistry on GJ 1214b's transmission spectrum are therefore minimal, with the largest effects taking place if the planet's atmosphere has super-solar metallicity and a low rate of vertical mixing. Interestingly, we find that the best fit to the observations of GJ 1214b's atmosphere in transmission occur if the planet's atmosphere is deficient in CH4, and possesses a cloud layer at a pressure of {\~{}}200 mbar. This is consistent with a picture of efficient methane photolysis, accompanied by formation of organic haze that obscures the lower atmosphere of GJ 1214b at optical wavelengths. However, for methane to be absent from GJ 1214b's transmission spectrum, UV photolysis of this molecule must be efficient at pressures of greater than {\~{}} 1 mbar, whereas we find that methane only photolyzes to pressures less than 0.1 mbar, even under the most optimistic assumptions.

abstract = {Exoplanets at small orbital distances from their host stars are submitted to intense levels of energetic radiations, X-rays and extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Depending on the masses and densities of the planets and on the atmospheric heating efficiencies, the stellar energetic inputs can lead to atmospheric mass loss. These evaporation processes are observable in the ultraviolet during planetary transits. The aim of the present work is to quantify the mass-loss rates (dm/dt), heating efficiencies (eta), and lifetimes for the whole sample of transiting exoplanets, now including hot jupiters, hot neptunes, and hot super-earths. The mass-loss rates and lifetimes are estimated from an "energy diagram" for exoplanets, which compares the planet gravitational potential energy to the stellar X/EUV energy deposited in the atmosphere. We estimate the mass-loss rates of all detected transiting planets to be within 10{\^{}}6 to 10{\^{}}13 g/s for various conservative assumptions. High heating efficiencies would imply that hot exoplanets such the gas giants WASP-12b and WASP-17b could be completely evaporated within 1 Gyr. We further show that the heating efficiency can be constrained when dm/dt is inferred from observations and the stellar X/EUV luminosity is known. This leads us to suggest that eta {\~{}} 100{\%} in the atmosphere of the hot jupiter HD209458b, while it could be lower for HD189733b. Simultaneous observations of transits in the ultraviolet and X-rays are necessary to further constrain the exospheric properties of exoplanets.},
